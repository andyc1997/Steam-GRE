## Background

### Business Question
Performing product positioning in real-time is often required in the current fast-paced environment in particular products with short life cycles. 
A vivid example is the video game industry. 
According to [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/), there are 18,641 games released on Steam in 2024. 
The business question relevant in this setting, to both developers and analysts, is *how to understand the position of your game in the global market, whether you are planning to produce a computer game or to analyze an existing game*.

### Pain Point
Let say if you are planning to make a horror game, you would like to know what kind of horror games are available in the market, and how their buyers perceive the quality of horror games. 
Currently, product or market analysts are conducting their analysis through manual reviews of unstructured data such as game description and user comments. 
Furthermore, it is hard for analysts to understand foreign markets because of language barriers.
The manual process can be broken down into two steps:

1. Identify computer games with similar characteristics based on their tags on Steam.
2. Review user comments based on how many people think it is "helpful" or the time of posting the comment. 

As such, an automated solution using LLM-based text embedding models is proposed.

## Public Dataset
Our solution is based on two public datasets on Kaggle:

1. A complete list of Steam games (40.21 MB, 55.7k records): [All 55,000 Games on Steam (November 2022)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tristan581/all-55000-games-on-steam-november-2022)
2. A list of game reviews (8.17 GB, 21.7m records): [Steam Reviews Dataset 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/najzeko/steam-reviews-2021)

The data files are stored in Cloud Storage and then loaded to BigQuery according to the [schema](/schema/).

## Solution
Our solution is based on Vector Search in SQL because it can be integrated easily as a backend process in deployment.
The embedding model is `text-embedding-004`.
The automated workflow is sequential which accepts user queries in two steps:

The first user query is used to retrieve games satisfying the semantic description of game characteristics or elements e.g.

+ I would like to find a multi-person strategic game on farming in an open-world setting.
+ I would like to find a multi-person action RPG game with dragon

Vector search can be applied to textual fields in the first dataset consisting of a complete list of Steam games. 
To ensure accurate matching, two columns from the first dataset is used: `short description` and `tags`. 
A game will be returned as a result only if the semantic meaning of both game descriptions and tags are highly relevant to the user query.
Technically, it is done by an inner join in SQL after embeddings are created.

The second user query is used to explore user comments based on the previous extracted list of games.
It automates the analysis of customer perceptions of product features across multiple countries:
