# Automated Product Positioning Tools: Steam Game 
## Background
Performing product positioning in real-time is often required in the current fast-paced environment in particular products with short life cycles. 
A vivid example is the video game industry. 
According to [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/), there are 18,641 games released on Steam in 2024. 
The business question relevant in this setting, to both developers and analysts, is *how to understand the position of your game in the global market*.
Let say if you are planning to make a horror game, you would like to know what kind of horror games are available in the market, and how their buyers perceive the quality of horror games, and how their perceptions differ across different regions or countries.

From an economic perspective, this question is also valid for other products with similar characteristics: 
+ short life cycles 
+ large amount of sellers and buyers
