Creating text embeddings with text-embedding-004 was convenient and fit nicely. However, generating embeddings turned out to be quite costly and often took a long time to finish, which made experimenting a bit tough during the hackathon. For example, we cannot create and store two vector indexes for the same dataset for searching. There may be two columns that need to be searched independently due to unproportionate text length. We also found that common table expression (CTE) is not well integrated for vector_search and ml.generate_embedding in SQL.
